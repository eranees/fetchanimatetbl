# README
This repository contains a simple HTML file (index.html) and a JavaScript file (script2.js) that demonstrate fetching data from an API and dynamically populating an animated HTML table with the retrieved data.

# Prerequisites
To run this code, you need a web browser that supports JavaScript.

# Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
# Usage
The index.html file contains an HTML table (#myTable) with three columns: Name, Email, and City. The data for these columns is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API using JavaScript.
The table has the following special features:
The table rows (<tr>) have alternating background colors to improve readability.
Hovering over a table row highlights it with a different background color and changes the cursor to a pointer.
When a cell (<td>) is clicked, an animation is triggered, increasing the font size of the cell's content over a period of 5 seconds.
The JavaScript code in script2.js uses the fetch function to retrieve data from the API. It then iterates over the retrieved data and dynamically generates HTML table rows with the corresponding data. Each table row has click event listeners attached to its cells that trigger the showData function.

The showData function logs the ID of the clicked cell to the console and applies a CSS animation (mymove) to the clicked cell, increasing its font size over a period of 5 seconds.
